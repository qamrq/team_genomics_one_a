## Team Genomics One-A
 Team work is an essential part of any workspace. It helps achieve goals faster and also in a more efficient way. Here we are a diverse group of Genomics enthusiasts working towards a common goal and simultaneously learning from one another!üòÑ

## Task 
The task is to look for a bioinformatic tutorial  that correlates with our biostack ( which is genomics). Then to create a quick and simple design for our desired tutorial and advertise it on transfer market channel on Slack workspace.  Once we reproduce the task, we should go on and  create a comprehensive markdown of the step by step and send a GitHub link to the file. 
How exciting!üòç



## Project title - Exome sequencing data analysis for diagnosing a genetic diseases.
Exome sequencing is a method that enables the selective sequencing of the exonic regions of a genome - that is the transcribed parts of the genome present in mature mRNA, including protein-coding sequences, but also untranslated regions (UTRs).

In humans, there are about 180,000 exons with a combined length of ~ 30 million base pairs (30 Mb). Thus, the exome represents only 1% of the human genome, but has been estimated to harbor up to 85% of all disease-causing variants ([Choi et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768590/)).

Exome sequencing, thus, offers an affordable alternative to whole-genome sequencing in the diagnosis of genetic disease, while still covering far more potential disease-causing variant sites than genotyping arrays. This is of special relevance in the case of rare genetic diseases, for which the causative variants may occur at too low a frequency in the human population to be included on genotyping arrays.

Of note, a recent study focusing on the area of clinical pediatric neurology indicates that the costs of exome sequencing may actually not be higher even today than the costs of conventional genetic testing ([Vissers et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5589982/)).

## Project Title: "Diagnosis of Osteopetrosis using  Exome Sequencing Data Analysis" :computer:
Have a look at the New state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic genetic test-"Exome Sequencing"

There are around 180,000 exons in humans, with a total length of approximately 30 million base pairs (30 Mb). Thus, while accounting for only 1% of the human genome, the exome is thought to include up to 85% of all disease-causing mutations.

Exome sequencing, as an alternative to whole-genome sequencing in the detection of genetic disease, is less expensive while yet covering significantly more potential disease-causing variant sites than genotyping arrays. This is especially important in the case of rare genetic conditions, since the causal variations may present in the human population at too low a frequency to be included on genotyping arrays.

Our Lab of Genomics-One-A will investigate :detective: exome sequencing data from a family triple:family_man_woman_boy: in which the boy child has osteopetrosis (rare genetic disorder with abnormally dense bones:bone: and prone to breakage) and both parents, who are consanguineous, are unaffected. Our lab‚Äôs goal is to figure out which genetic variant is causing the condition.

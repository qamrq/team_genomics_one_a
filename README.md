 Team work is an essential part of any workspace. It helps achieve goals faster and also in a more efficient way. Here we are a diverse group of Genomics enthusiasts working as a team towards a common goal and simultaneously learning from one another!üòÑ

## Stage 2 Task üßêüßê
The task is to look for a bioinformatic tutorial  that correlates with our biostack ( which is genomics). Then to create a quick and simple design for our desired tutorial and advertise it on transfer market channel on Slack workspace.  Once we reproduce the task, we should go on and  create a comprehensive markdown of the step by step and send a GitHub link to the file. 
How exciting!üòç

## Project Title - Diagnosis of Osteopetrosis using  Exome Sequencing Data Analysis
Have a look at the New state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic genetic test- "Exome Sequencing"
There are around 180,000 exons in humans, with a total length of approximately 30 million base pairs (30 Mb). Thus, while accounting for only 1% of the human genome, the exome is thought to include up to 85% of all disease-causing mutations.
Exome sequencing, as an alternative to whole-genome sequencing in the detection of genetic disease, is less expensive while yet covering significantly more potential disease-causing variant sites than genotyping arrays.
This is especially important in the case of rare genetic conditions, since the causal variations may present in the human population at too low a frequency to be included on genotyping arrays.
Our Lab of Genomics-One-A :female-scientist::male-scientist:will investigate exome sequencing data from a family triple:man-woman-boy: in which the boy child has osteopetrosis (rare genetic disorder with abnormally dense bones:bone: and prone to breakage) and both parents, who are consanguineous, are unaffected. Our lab‚Äôs goal is to figure out which genetic variant is causing the condition.
